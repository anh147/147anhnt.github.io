About me
======
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.55; color:#333; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:14px;">
I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Robotics Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology (VNU Hanoi), where my research focused on applying artificial intelligence to robot perception and biomedical imaging. This work strengthened my foundation in computer vision, machine learning, and the integration of AI in complex sensing systems.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.55; color:#333; text-align:justify;">
My current research interests include vision-language models (VLMs), multi-modal large language models (LLMs), and reasoning in AI. I am particularly interested in developing multi-modal frameworks for grounded understanding and compositional reasoning, with applications in face anti-spoofing detection, video content understanding, and culturally-aware image captioning in the Vietnamese context.
