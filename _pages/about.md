About me
======
I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Robotics Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology (VNU Hanoi), where my research focused on applying artificial intelligence to robot perception and biomedical imaging. This work strengthened my foundation in computer vision, machine learning, and the integration of AI in complex sensing systems.

My current research interests include vision-language models (VLMs), multi-modal large language models (LLMs), and reasoning in AI. I am particularly interested in developing multi-modal frameworks for grounded understanding and compositional reasoning, with applications in face anti-spoofing detection, video content understanding, and culturally-aware image captioning in the Vietnamese context.

For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
